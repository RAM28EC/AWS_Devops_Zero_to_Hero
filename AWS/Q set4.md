## what is zero trust security model?
The Zero Trust security model is a cybersecurity framework that rejects the traditional assumption of trust within a network and instead operates on the principle of verifying and validating every user, device, and application attempting to connect to resources. It assumes that threats can come from both internal and external sources.

**Key principles of the Zero Trust security model include:**

**Verify Identity:** Instead of trusting users and devices based on their location or network, Zero Trust emphasizes the need to verify the identity of users, devices, and applications before granting access.

**Least Privilege:** Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This minimizes the potential damage that can occur if a user account is compromised.

**Micro-Segmentation:** Networks are segmented into smaller, isolated zones to contain potential breaches. This way, even if an attacker gains access to one segment, their movement within the network is restricted.

**Continuous Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of user and device behavior is crucial in a Zero Trust model. This involves analyzing network traffic, user activities, and other relevant data to detect any anomalous behavior that might indicate a security threat.

**Encryption:** Encrypting data both in transit and at rest adds an additional layer of security in a Zero Trust model, protecting information even if it falls into the wrong hands.
