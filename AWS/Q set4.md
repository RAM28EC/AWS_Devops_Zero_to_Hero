## what is zero trust security model?
The Zero Trust security model is a cybersecurity framework that rejects the traditional assumption of trust within a network and instead operates on the principle of verifying and validating every user, device, and application attempting to connect to resources. It assumes that threats can come from both internal and external sources.

**Key principles of the Zero Trust security model include:**

**Verify Identity:** Instead of trusting users and devices based on their location or network, Zero Trust emphasizes the need to verify the identity of users, devices, and applications before granting access.

**Least Privilege:** Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This minimizes the potential damage that can occur if a user account is compromised.
